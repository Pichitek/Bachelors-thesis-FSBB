# Laboratory model of Four Switch Buck-Boost converter

This project was part of my bachelors thesis at AGH University of Krak√≥w. It contains schematic and PCB design made in Altium Designer 23, simulations of sensing ciruits, filters etc. made in LTSpice, control loop simulation conducted in Simulink and imprementation of control algorithm on STM32G4 microcontroller.

Due to lack of time, this project was finished in its simulation stage, although both schematic and PCB were reviewed by supervisor.

In this repository you can find:
* images folder with all screenshots, plots used while writing thesis
* sch_pcb folder with Altium Designer project
* sim folder with .asc files made in LTSpice
* src folder with control loop simulation, STMCubeIDE project and Jupyter notebook for calculations 
* .pdf's with schematic and thesis (as mentioned, it is written in polish)
* .ppt file which was presented during my defense (also in polish)
